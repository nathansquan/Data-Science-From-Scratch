    "## Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vectors:** Abstractly, they are objects that can be added together to from new vectors and that can be multiplied by *scalars*, also to form new vectors. Concretely, vectors are points in some finite-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are a useful way to represent numeric data.\n",

    "For example, if we have height, weight, and age data on people, we can treat our data as three-dimensional vectors `[height, weight, age]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A from-scratch representation of vectors is as lists of numbers. A list of three numbers corresponds to a vector in three-dimensional space, and vice versa. We'll accomplish this with a type alias that says a `Vector` is just a `list` of `floats`:"

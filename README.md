# Data Science From Scratch Notes

I am self-teaching myself *Data Science From Scratch* by Joel Grus:

Grus, Joel (2019) *Data science from scratch: first principles with Python*,
Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly Media

The files in this repository are Jupyter Notebooks of my notes from each
chapter.

My goals for this project are:

    1. To teach myself the fundamentals of data science
    2. Learn how to implement these data science methods in Python
